# Buckley-Leverett-semi-analytical
I've benchmarked my solver against the semi-analytical solution of Buckley Leverett Theory. In the following animation, you see water movement within a reservoir during an injection process. The solid line depicts the semi-analytical solution, while the dots represent the results generated by our solver.
